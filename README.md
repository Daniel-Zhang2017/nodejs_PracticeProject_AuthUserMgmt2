The error node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1215 throw err; indicates that a Node.js application failed to load a required module. 

The project's dependencies were never installed, were accidentally deleted, or became corrupted. 

Solution: Reinstall the dependencies by deleting the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json file, then run the install command.

sh
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json # Use 'del node_modules package-lock json' on Windows
npm install
